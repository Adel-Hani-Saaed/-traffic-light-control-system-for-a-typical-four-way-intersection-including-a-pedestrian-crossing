# Traffic Light Control System with Pedestrian Crossing

## Overview
This project implements a traffic light control system for a typical four-way intersection, with a pedestrian crossing feature. The system is designed using an FSM (Finite State Machine) for structured state transitions. This project is part of the ReNile Embedded Systems evaluation process.

---

## Features
1. Traffic light control for two main streets (Red, Yellow, Green LEDs).
2. Pedestrian crossing system with request buttons and Walk/Don't Walk signals.
3. Emergency pedestrian override mode to prioritize safety.
4. System implemented using FSM for state-based control.
5. Timed light cycles with smooth transitions.

---

## Hardware Requirements
1. Microcontroller: Atmega32.
2. LEDs:
   - **Traffic Lights**: 6 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green for each street).
   - **Pedestrian Signals**: 2 LEDs (Walk, Donâ€™t Walk for each street).
3. Push Buttons:
   - For pedestrian crossing requests.
4. Resistors and breadboard for connections.
5. Power supply (e.g., USB or battery pack).

---

## Testing Scenarios
1. Normal traffic light cycle without pedestrian request:
**Street 1 and Street 2 alternate in Red/Yellow/Green states.**
2. Pedestrian crossing request:
**Pedestrian button press triggers pedestrian crossing signal and stops traffic.**
3. Transition back to normal mode after pedestrian crossing.

## Software Description
1. **Architecture**:  
   - The system uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** with states such as:
     - Normal Traffic Mode
     - Pedestrian Request Mode
     - Emergency Mode (override).
   - Each state has defined transitions triggered by timers or button presses.

2. **State Diagram**:

3. **Code Highlights**:
   - Organized into modular functions for readability.
   - Includes proper comments for every line/block.
   - Utilizes `delay` for timing and debouncing techniques for button handling.
